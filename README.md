# das-EzBooruTagEditor
I created this app to speed up and facilitate in the best possible way, at least until I notice some significant improvement, the management of Booru-style tags. The main use of this type of tag for me is in the fine-tuning of Stable Diffusion models, where the tags have even greater importance than the actual image dataset.

I'm making the final adjustments and tests before making the code publicly available. The code is quite large and relatively complex, but due to the fact that it deals with a low data flow, I kept it entirely in a single file, to avoid complicating what can be easy.
