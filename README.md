## Introduction
This application is designed to accelerate and simplify the management of Booru-style tags, primarily for fine-tuning Stable Diffusion models where tags play a crucial role, often more significant than the actual image dataset.

## Installation

You can set up das-EzBooruTagEditor on your system in two ways:

### Option 1: Using the Executable
- **Download the Executable**: Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/DevArqSangoi/das-EzBooruTagEditor/releases) page and download the latest `.exe` file.
- **Run**: Double-click the downloaded file to run the application. No installation or Python environment required.

### Option 2: Cloning the Repository
- **Clone the Repository**: Run `git clone https://github.com/DevArqSangoi/das-EzBooruTagEditor.git` to clone the repository to your local machine.
- **Navigate to the Directory**: Change to the directory where the repository was cloned. E.g., `cd das-EzBooruTagEditor`.
- **Install Dependencies**: Install the Pillow library by running `pip install Pillow` in your command line. This is necessary for image processing.
- **Run the Script**: Execute the script with `python EzBooruTagEditor.py`.

## Operation Guide
### Starting Up
- **Select Folder**: From the home screen, choose the folder containing images and their respective text files (.txt).

- **Navigation**: Navigate through images using (in the order of navigation shown in the gif) mouse scroll with the cursor on the image frame, by clicking in the list, with the keyboard arrows (up and down), or by using the buttons on the interface.

### Managing Tags
- **Viewing and Selecting Tags**:
  - The left-hand list populates with text files having corresponding images.
  - Selecting a list item displays the image and tags.
- **Editing Tags**:
  - **Delete**: Click a tag once to select, and again to delete.

  - **Undo Deletion**: Click 'Undo' or use 'Ctrl+Z'.

  - **Add Tag**: Enter the tag in the text box and press "Add Tag" or "Enter". Unique tags are added to a unique list; similar tags are grouped.

  - **Customizing Tag Grouping**:
    - Similar tags can be grouped by editing the `config.json` file using the format `"words": ["gloves", "hair", "footwear"]`.
    - This file is automatically generated after running the program and viewing the first image. Users can add or modify the listed words to define their own tag groupings.

### Saving
- **Save Changes**: Press 'Save' or use 'Ctrl+S'.

### Important Notes
- **ðŸ›‘ Backup First**: **Always back up your tag files before using this app.** This step is crucial to protect your data against any unintended changes.
- **Non-Real-Time Editing**: Changes are not real-time; navigate away to discard large mistakes.
- **Save Before Switching**: Unsaved changes are lost when switching images. Future updates may include memory-based temporary saving.

## Future Plans
I plan to introduce memory-based modifications in the app to prevent the loss of unsaved changes when switching between images.

## Changelog

### [2023-11-21]
A special thanks to [@Nenotriple](https://github.com/Nenotriple) for their assistance in testing the app and identifying key improvements and bugs to be addressed. [#1](https://github.com/DevArqSangoi/das-EzBooruTagEditor/issues/1)

### New Implementations

- **Manual Tag Grouping with JSON Configuration**: Transitioned from the automatic grouping of tags based on common words to a user-driven approach using a JSON file. Users now have direct control over tag associations, defining their own groupings in the `config.json`. This update eliminates the program's previous behavior of automatic tag duplication, offering a tailored tagging experience.

- **Enhanced Alphanumeric Sorting Logic**: Improved the file sorting algorithm to use natural alphanumeric ordering, ensuring that filenames are sorted in an intuitive sequence (e.g., '2' comes before '10').

- **WebP Image Support**: Added support for WebP images. The application now recognizes `.webp` along with other common image formats (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`).

- **UI Enhancement for Token Deletion**: Updated the color for the delete token highlight, enhancing visual clarity and user experience.

### Bug Fixes

- **Interface Clearing on New Directory Selection**: Corrected a minor bug where previously selected images and tags were persisting after a new directory was chosen. Now, the interface is cleared, ensuring a fresh start with each directory change.

- **Improved Choose Directory Handling**: Addressed an issue where canceling out of the "Choose Directory" dialog would lead to a loss of reference to the currently selected directory. Previously, this would leave the file list populated but non-functional. The program now retains the reference to the current directory unless a new one is explicitly chosen, ensuring continuous access to the file list.

- **Duplicate Tag Handling**: Fixed a major bug where duplicate tags shown in the UI were being saved as duplicates in the text file. This fix prevents the unintended duplication of tags in the saved files.

- **Token Deletion Bug**: Addressed a major bug where the token delete function stopped working if the user selected a token but moved to the next/previous image without deleting it.
